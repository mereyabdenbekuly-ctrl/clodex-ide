# Repository map

## Applications

### `apps/browser`

The Electron IDE.

- `src/backend/main.ts` — service composition and application startup;
- `src/backend/agent-host` — isolated agent utility process;
- `src/backend/mcp-host` — isolated MCP utility process;
- `src/backend/services` — host services;
- `src/shared` — renderer/backend contracts and validation schemas;
- `src/ui` — React application;
- `src/pages` — isolated pages and generated-app surfaces;
- `scripts` — packaging, evidence, dogfood, release, and smoke tooling;
- `bundled` — assets embedded into the application;
- `.storybook` and `visual-regression` — deterministic UI fixtures.

### `apps/clodex-cli`

Headless host for Agent Core. It demonstrates the minimum integration contract:
host paths, models, persistence, AgentManager, domain adapters, mounts, and
shell tools.

### `apps/update-server`

Update metadata and installer delivery service.

### `apps/website`

Product website and static content.

### `apps/deprecated-cli`

Legacy command-line application. New runtime development should target
`apps/clodex-cli`.

## Core packages

### `packages/agent-core`

Provider-neutral agent runtime: agents, AgentManager, prompt composition,
mounts, persistence, Context Ledger, Model Fabric, runner routing, toolbox,
plans, logs, attachments, and diff history.

### `packages/agent-shell`

PTY and shell execution: sessions, command framing, terminal logging, shell
integration, and the local execution engine.

### `packages/mcp-runtime`

MCP protocol and transports: stdio, HTTP, OAuth, tools, prompts, resources,
elicitation, cancellation, timeout, restart, and redaction.

### `packages/karton`

Typed state synchronization and RPC between browser processes.

### `packages/runner-sdk`

Public contracts for custom execution providers: manifests, job admission,
leases, artifacts, signed receipts, and capability declarations.

### UI and support packages

- `packages/stage-ui` — shared React primitives;
- `packages/nucleo-*` — local icon packages;
- `packages/typescript-config` — TypeScript configuration;
- `packages/tailwindcss-color-modifiers` — design-token utilities.
